Alexa controlled ESP8266 with solenoid actuator

Aruino sketch that uses the fauxmoESP library (https://bitbucket.org/xoseperez/fauxmoesp) to emulate a Belkin WeMo device on an ESP8266 module, to enable it to be controlled with Alexa via an Amazon Echo. 

The sketch is used to actuate a solenoid (to manually switch on an electric kettle) with the voice command: "Alexa, turn the kettle on".
